        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>MoldDetect</strong>, a web platform dedicated to helping homeowners,
          tenants, and building managers identify potential mold growth in indoor environments.
          Mold can pose serious health risks, especially for children, elderly, and individuals
          with respiratory issues.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h5>
        <p>
          We aim to provide a quick, reliable, and accessible tool for assessing indoor air
          quality risks using advanced image analysis techniques. Our platform uses a
          combination of computer vision models and explainable AI to help you detect areas
          where mold may be present in your home.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">How It Works</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Create an account or Sign In to Upload a photo of the area you want to inspect.</li>
          <li>Our model analyzes the image to determine the likelihood of mold growth.</li>
          <li>Receive a clear, color-coded result with confidence levels and health advisories.</li>
          <li>View a heatmap to understand where the model detected potential mold patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="mt-4">Why It Matters</h5>
        <p>
          Early detection of mold can prevent serious health issues and costly repairs.
          By making mold detection easier and more interactive, we hope to empower users
          to take proactive measures in keeping their homes safe and healthy.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">Get Involved</h5>
        <p>
          Users can provide feedback on predictions to help improve the model, track their
          upload history, and stay informed about indoor safety. Administrators can manage
          users, retrain models, and monitor analytics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
